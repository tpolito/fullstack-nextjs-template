# Next.js GraphQL Scaffold

A scaffold I created for my own projects contains a _mostly_ ready to go full stack Next.js app configued with:

- GraphQL API routes
  - Pothos
- Prisma
- next-auth
- Mantine

## Todo

- [ ] Add a GraphQL client on the backend
- [ ] Setup a npx package to streamline the install
